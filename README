I am writing this article to demonstrate the creation of a real-world Crowdsale Smart Contract with the following improvements/characteristics:

A Mintable ERC20 token where total supply increases as people purchase the tokens
A refundable crowdsale with a goal and hard cap
Presale support
Ability to offer Presale discount
Security

Here are some of the tools we are going to use:

node 8 & npm
Truffle Framework
Ganache
Open Zeppelin
MetaMask
